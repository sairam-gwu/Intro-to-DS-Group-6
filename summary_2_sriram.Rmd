## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
games<-read.csv('Video games sales.csv')
str(games)

```

```{r}

games$Platform<-as.factor(games$Platform)
games$Year_of_Release<-as.factor(games$Year_of_Release)
games$Genre<-as.factor(games$Genre)
games$Publisher<-as.factor(games$Publisher)
games$Developer<-as.factor(games$Developer)
games$Rating<-as.factor(games$Rating)
str(games)
```


```{r}
games<-na.omit(games)
unique(games$Rating)
games$Rating <- ifelse( games$Rating== "", NA,games$Rating )
unique(games$Rating)
games<-subset(games,games$Rating!="NA")
games<-subset(games,games$Year_of_Release!="N/A")
nrow(games)


games_final= outlierKD2(games,Global_Sales,rm=TRUE,hist=FALSE)
games_final<-na.omit(games_final)
