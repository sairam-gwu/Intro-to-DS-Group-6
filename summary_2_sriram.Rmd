## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```

The above graph represents the total global sales of video games, grouped by their genre.

* Action games are the most popular, with total sales far exceeding the other genres with sales more than 1000.
* Followed by Action genre sports are the second most popular genre , with sales around 750.
* The least sold games we puzzles and strategy as we know most of these types of games are played by less amount of people


```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(ggrepel)


games$Year_of_Release <- as.numeric(as.character(games$Year_of_Release))

na_sales <- games %>%
  group_by(Year_of_Release, Genre) %>%
  summarise(NA_Sales = sum(NA_Sales, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()


na_best_selling_genres <- na_sales %>%
  arrange(desc(NA_Sales)) %>%
  group_by(Year_of_Release) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  ungroup()

# Create a bar plot for NA region only with each genre a different color
na_genre_sales_plot <- ggplot(na_best_selling_genres, aes(x = Year_of_Release, y = NA_Sales, fill = Genre)) +

  labs(title = "NA Annual Sales with Best-Selling Genre Highlighted", x = "Year of Release", y = "Sales") +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) 

print(na_genre_sales_plot)

 


```

The graph displays the annual sales of the best-selling video game genres in North America, with each bar representing a specific year.

*  A period dominated by action games might be followed by a surge in the popularity of sports games.

```

We are using logistic regression model to predict if a games is hit or not based on the threshold value.
we are using **Critic Score** , **Developer** and **Genre** as predicotrs.
For making logistic model at first we are using binning function. Binning top developers because there are likely many unique developers in the dataset. Without binning, the model would have too many variables (one for each developer), many of which would have little data, leading to overfitting and making the model less generalizable. By binning, you reduce the complexity of the model and focus on the most common developers. 

**Coefficients and p-values:**
 These values represent the change in the log odds of the dependent variable (in your case, whether a game is a 'hit' or not) for a one-unit change in the predictor.
 
**Critic_Score (Coefficient: 0.053450, p-value: < 2e-16)**
* This is a highly significant predictor. The positive coefficient indicates that higher critic scores are associated with a higher likelihood of a game being a hit. The extremely low p-value suggests this relationship is statistically significant.


**Developer456 (Coefficient: 0.865595, p-value: 0.04698)**

* This specific developer (represented as 'Developer456') has a positive impact on the likelihood of a game being a hit. The p-value is just under 0.05, indicating that this result is statistically significant, although it's on the borderline.

**GenreAdventure (Coefficient: -0.960955, p-value: 7.50e-05)**

* Being an adventure game is associated with a lower likelihood of being a hit, as indicated by the negative coefficient. The p-value is very small, showing strong evidence against the null hypothesis.

**GenrePuzzle (Coefficient: -0.824972, p-value: 0.00954)**

Puzzle games are also less likely to be hits. The negative coefficient and its low p-value signify a strong and statistically significant relationship.

**GenreRole-Playing (Coefficient: -0.344525, p-value: 0.00792)**

* Role-Playing games have a negative coefficient, suggesting they are less likely to be hits compared to the baseline genre. The p-value indicates this finding is statistically significant.

**GenreStrategy (Coefficient: -1.142691, p-value: 2.89e-07)**

* Strategy games show a strong negative association with being a hit. The coefficient is significantly negative, and the very low p-value strongly supports its significance.


**Null Devience:**

* Null deviance shows the goodness of fit of a model with no predictors (only the intercept) and residual deviance shows the goodness of fit of your model. A lower residual deviance compared to the null deviance indicates that the model is a better fit than the null model.
